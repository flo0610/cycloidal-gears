# Cycloidal Gear Generator for Fusion 360
### _**Note that this project is a current work in progress, and that this is V1.**_

This is an [Autodesk Fusion 360](http://fusion360.autodesk.com/) add-in for generating cycloidal gears.  Given the input parameters, it will create 3 bodies in a new sketch: cycloidal disk, base plate, and cam.

## Installation

This portion was copied from the wonderful [Voronoi Diagram Generator for Fusion 360](https://github.com/hanskellner/Fusion360Voronoi).

Installing the add-in in the Fusion 360 Addins folder allows it to automatically be found and displayed in the add-ins list.

### Mac Add-Ins Folder

```
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/"
```

### Windows Add-Ins Folder

```
"C:\Users\%YOUR_USER_NAME%\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns"
```

1. With your Finder or File Explorer window, locate the AddIns folder.
1. Create a folder within the AddIns folder with the same name as the add-in.  In this case, "CycloidalGear".
1. Extract all of the add-in files from the (ZIP) archive and place them in this folder.
1. Now the add-in is ready for Fusion 360.  Start Fusion 360.
1. Display the Scripts and Add-Ins dialog.  The "CycloidalGear" add-in should be listed.
1. See the *Usage* section below for running and using.

> As an alternative to the above installation location, you can just place the files in their own folder within a location of your choice.  For example, in your Documents or Home folder.  Doing this means the add-in will not automatically appear in the add-ins list.  You will need to manually add it using the "+" button at the top of the list.

There is additional installation help on the Fusion 360 site:

## Usage
COMING SOON

## Example
Within the **Example** folder above, you can find a Fusion 360 file that contains a cycloidal gear setup that was generated by the script. In addition to this, are also the 3 STL files the script generates, so you can use them as test prints. The tolerances are set to 0.5 mm, which is optimal for when I printed it on my CR-10.

## About Cycloidal Gears
*Why go cycloidal?* I'm glad you asked!

Cycloidal gears are neat in my book not only because of their looks, but also because of the way they work. Normal gears with teeth are quite easy to understand intuitively, but the first time you look at a cycloidal gear it might be hard to see how it achieves the reduction it does. Essentially, they represent a drastic reduction in revolutions and increase in torque in a pretty compact package.

One common application of cycloidal gears and drives is in robotics. This is because with normal gears(of the involute variety), they have a tendency to slip. So, as you can imagine, if you're controlling a robot and you tell it to go forward 1 meter but due to gear slipping in your gearbox it only goes forward 0.98 meters, you might be in a pickle depending on your application. Because of the geometry of cycloidal gears, this is less of a concern. So, if you use cycloidal gearing in robotics you not only have a great amount of torque to surmount obstacles, but can finely tune your movements.

## TODO

- validate user inputs (ie if a cam radius is too large for a given design, alert the user)
- perform robustness tests
- make a script to create a cycloidal drive
- more COMING SOON
