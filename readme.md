# Cycloidal Gear Generator for Fusion 360
This is an [Autodesk Fusion 360](http://fusion360.autodesk.com/) add-in for generating cycloidal gears.  Given the input parameters, it will create 3 bodies in a new sketch: cycloidal disk, base plate, and cam.

## Installation

This portion was copied from the wonderful [Voronoi Diagram Generator for Fusion 360](https://github.com/hanskellner/Fusion360Voronoi).

Installing the add-in in the Fusion 360 Addins folder allows it to automatically be found and displayed in the add-ins list.

### Mac Add-Ins Folder

```
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/"
```

### Windows Add-Ins Folder

```
"C:\Users\%YOUR_USER_NAME%\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns"
```

1. With your Finder or File Explorer window, locate the AddIns folder.
1. Create a folder within the AddIns folder with the same name as the add-in.  In this case, "CycloidalGear".
1. Extract all of the add-in files from the (ZIP) archive and place them in this folder.
1. Now the add-in is ready for Fusion 360.  Start Fusion 360.
1. Display the Scripts and Add-Ins dialog.  The "CycloidalGear" add-in should be listed.
1. See the *Usage* section below for running and using.

> As an alternative to the above installation location, you can just place the files in their own folder within a location of your choice.  For example, in your Documents or Home folder.  Doing this means the add-in will not automatically appear in the add-ins list.  You will need to manually add it using the "+" button at the top of the list.

There is additional installation help on the Fusion 260 site:
